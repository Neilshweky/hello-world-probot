Hey! This is my "Hello, World" app for Probot's Google Summer of Code application. I tried to trick it out a little to prove my knowledge of the APIs. I hope you like it!

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.
